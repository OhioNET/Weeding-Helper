v 2.0.a.09 - ??

- removed Display Settings button from nav when no default table selected

v 2.0.a.08 - 28 August 2014
- changed css in controller to elimate the blue button border that IE added by default
- fixed bug that had each column displaying twice in csv.php
- nav.php never displays all tools in header on index/controller page, only on other pages (avoids confusion about which table is active default)

v 2.0.a.07 - 28 August 2014
- index.php used to be a copy of controller.php (why?). Now index points to controller so only one needs to be updated. The short lived 2.0.a.06 release had non-matching index and controllers, revealing this long-standing error. Fixed now. 
- tidied up csv.php -- added attribution for where the code came from, removed an earlier version of the coded that had been commented out

v 2.0.a.06 - 28 August 2014
- added the long-awaited CSV download option

v 2.0.a.05 - 25 August 2014
- update Display Settings defaults to reflect item-based database fields
- fixed bug that made some Display Settings defaults unchangeable
- added $debug variable to config-sample.php; changing to 'true' displays the $_REQUEST and $_SESSION variables in nav.php. Could be later expanded to display other debugging information.

v 2.0.a.04 - 11 August 2014
- corrected display of version number in footer

v. 2.0.a.03 - 12 July 2013 
 - switched from php short tags (<?) to fully qualified php tags (<?php)

v. 2.0.a.02 - 15 July 2013
 - moved session_start() command to the beginning of each file -- should make some servers happier.

v. 2.0.a.01 - 12 July 2013
 - major revision! version 2 treats each volume as an individual item, whereas the original version treated each bib record (and all its attached items) as one unit. this should make shelf-list checking more meaningful, and the InnReach checking function attempts to differentiate between volume numbers (including variations like "v.1", "V.1", "vol. 1", etc.)
 - NEW IMPORT FORMAT! version 2 uses different fields than version 1. This means that the fields exported from Millennium/Sierra will be different than before
 - Version 2 is not backward-compatible with version 1; a new installation will be required
 - fixed minor bug: settings.php now handles the "renews" field correctly

v. 1.0.9 - 12 June 2013
 - darkened text in the view.php table (using ajaxCRUD css)
 - added missing fields values to table_config setup in mysql_connect.php (this fixes a bug that prevented some settings from being changed)

v. 1.0.8 - 22 April 2013
 - increased memory limit on innreach_check to 128MB (was system default); this should prevent many of the hangups that plagued the earlier versions. 
 - added link to export format on upload page, clarified rules on table_name
 - allow user to delete files awaiting cron ingestion, e.g. bad format
 - updated to ajaxCRUD v7.91
 - moved html headers on view.php to lower in the page so as to not conflict with ajaxCRUD's need to do a few things first; this fixes the bug that required a reload of the page to see user-initiated changes to the record information
 - added variables for future FileChucker support to config-sample.php
 - added a "remove conditions" button on view.php & print.php after the user invokes the advanced search
 - prevented duplicate table names on upload

v. 1.0.7 - 20 November 2012
 - added GetTableNames() script to scripts.php - return an array of human-friendly names, keyed to mysql table_name
 - fixed bug in settings.php: can now turn off columns in print view (could previously only turn them ON)
 - show human-friendly names in settings.php
 - fixed bug so print settings take effect in print.php
 - if a user clicks the 'edit settings' button on the main page, go straight to those settings or offer them some choices if settings don't exist

v. 1.0.6 - 06 November 2012
 - added backticks to a mysql table call in ajaxcrud.class.php 
 - allowed for user to enter non-allowed characters in upload.php table name (non allowed characters will convert to underscores)

v. 1.0.5 - 29 October 2012
 - change line 180 in prep_file.php to .= instead of = ; this allows for multiple items with the same call number; previous versions disappeared subsequent items with duplicate call numbers
 - update innreach_check.php: call DOM parser with $path_main instead of ./ in the path -- works more reliably in some environments 
 - updated upload.php to fail verbosely when file is empty
 - changed innreach_check.php so that the oldest file is checked first against the InnReach catalog
 - updated config-sample.php to include $innreach[local_display_name] variable
 - updated innreach_check.php to use $innreach[local_display_name] variable
 - added $html->clear() to help manage memory issue on the dom parser in innreach_check.php
 - changed innreach_check.php to enter a value of -1 if innreach check cannot return a value. this should keep the process from stalling out. (this appears not to be working right yet)
 - added unstick.php to get the innreach checks unstuck when they hit a page they can't parse. added a call to this functionality from controller.php
 - updated view.php: show table title  

v. 1.0.4
 - added DeleteTable function to controller.php (deletes main data table, plus the associated text files on the server and the related line from the controller mysql table)
 - added delete.png to to the images/ folder
 - added changelog

v. 1.0.3
 - added a document-relative path where there had been a previously root-relative one in innreach_check.php

v. 1.0.2 
 - fixed a spot where the database name was hard-coded as 'weeding' instead of $MYSQL_DB in line 48 of mysql_connect.php

v. 1.0.1
 - first release version, bugs and all!
