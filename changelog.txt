v 2.0.a.07 - 28 August 2014
* index.php used to be a copy of controller.php (why?). Now index points to controller so only one needs to be updated. The short lived 2.0.a.06 release had non-matching index and controllers, revealing this long-standing error. Fixed now.

v. 2.0.a.01 - 12 July 2013
* major revision! version 2 treats each volume as an individual item, whereas the original version treated each bib record (and all its attached items) as one unit. this should make shelf-list checking more meaningful, and the InnReach checking function attempts to differentiate between volume numbers (including variations like "v.1", "V.1", "vol. 1", etc.)
* NEW IMPORT FORMAT! version 2 uses different fields than version 1. This means that the fields exported from Millennium/Sierra will be different than before

* allow user to delete files awaiting cron ingestion, e.g. bad format
* updated to ajaxCRUD v7.91

* fixed bug so print settings take effect in print.php
* if a user clicks the 'edit settings' button on the main page, go straight to those settings or offer them some choices if settings don't exist

v. 1.0.6 - 06 November 2012
* added backticks to a mysql table call in ajaxcrud.class.php
* allowed for user to enter non-allowed characters in upload.php table name (non allowed characters will convert to underscores)

v. 1.0.5 - 29 October 2012
* change line 180 in prep_file.php to .= instead of = ; this allows for multiple items with the same call number; previous versions disappeared subsequent items with duplicate call numbers

* added $html->clear() to help manage memory issue on the dom parser in innreach_check.php

* added unstick.php to get the innreach checks unstuck when they hit a page they can't parse. added a call to this functionality from controller.php
* updated view.php: show table title

v. 1.0.4
* added DeleteTable function to controller.php (deletes main data table, plus the associated text files on the server and the related line from the controller mysql table)

v. 1.0.1
* first release version, bugs and all!
